### Readability

#### Line spacing ####

* Aim for about 140%–180% for optimal readability and accessility
* Limit line length to 70–80 characters
* Font size should be minimum 16pt
* Experiment with tighter spacing on shorter texts (e.g. headlines)
* Use tools like the "Golden Ratio Typography Calculator" (https://grtcalculator.com/)
* WCAG AAA suggests a line height of 1.5

### Links

#### General

* Keep the linked phrase short (not more than 3–5 words)
* Make anchor text meaningful (avoid "Click here")

#### Underline

* Underlined links enhance scanability but have a negative effect on readability
* Color should not be the only visual clue to indicate a link
* Don't underline lists of links

#### Color

* Avoid coloring non-interactive text
* Blue is strongly associated with clickability
* Blue is the color most accessible for people with color deficiencies

### Infinite Scrolling

#### Problems

* Users will lose the page length orientation
* Scrollbar becomes useless
* No ability to jump to the end of the page
* Unable to return to the same in-page position
* No visible footer
* May be slow and use a lot of browser memory
* Lack of sense of completion (fear of missing out on data)
* Bad for SEO (elements after first scroll)

#### Alternatives

* Standard pagination
* Automatic loading of some content (instead of non-stop loading)

### Carousel

#### Problems

* Moving elements distract users
* People read at different pace (too slow/fast annoys, but impossible to set correct speed)
* Click-through rates are poor (< 5%)
* Motion of auto-revolving carousels make them look like banner ads, thus people ignore them

#### Alternatives

* Prioritize content and show each content in its own space
* Choose the most important content and display it

### Hamburger Icon

#### Problems

* Not everyone understands the meaning of the icon
* The hamburger icon is not very intuitive
* Looks more like a list than a menu icon
* Depends highly on the user base and their experience

#### Alternatives

* Add word "menu" to the icon
* Horizontal bar
